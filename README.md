### HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

### Introduction
In this challenge, the goal is to optimize the HTML and CSS Code. This was achieved by 'cleaning up' the code and removing duplicates and this was done by uisng the semantic HTML tags which are more descriptive and specific to the code.

### Method 
As mentioned above, generic HTML tags like <div> tags was replaced with more specific semantic tags such as:

 * `main`
 * `nav` 
 * `section`
 * `aside` 
 * `article`
 * `footer` tags
 
  These are more specific and improve the assesibility of the code, minimize repetitions as well as decrease the length of the code.

  The HTML and CSS codes were arranged and positioned in the order of occurance and `alt` attributes added to the <img> using appropriate descriptive naming.

### Comments
Comments were also added to the CSS to make it more descriptive and assessible to other developers.

### GitHub
[This github repository](https://github.com/MercyAz/Semantic-HTML-Code-Refactor-Challenge) was created for the challenge and was then cloned to the remote server where the project was done. Also serveral commits was made during the course of the work and it was finally deployed to the following [link](https://mercyaz.github.io/Semantic-HTML-Code-Refactor-Challenge/).
